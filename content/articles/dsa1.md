# Data Structures and Algotrithms - Day 1

## Confession
I'm not gonna pretend to be the God of Computer Science. This series is extremely selfish in it's genesis and is meant to act as a reference point of sorts for the future me to refer to. I'm gonna make blog posts as I go along, some might be short, some might be long. In the end, the age old question rises again - "Does size matter?"

## Context
Coding is somewhat of a fad these days, "Oh, you don't know how to code? What are you even doing with your engineering degree.". I would never acknowledge "coding" as a skillset. Knowing how to copy paste lines of text from a language's documentation is me telling you, "Ich habe einen sch√∂nen Hintern" while clutching a German dectionary in my armpits.

## I don't really care what you say Gursimran, I WANT TO CODE.
Well then, you better do it right. Printing out hello world or checking if a string is pallindrome can only take you so far. In the real world, there is this big bad bully called "constraints". It doesn't always let us be the "brute" that we like to be. So what do we do? We use data structures and algorithms.
