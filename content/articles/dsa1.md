# Data Structures and Algotrithms - Day 1

## Confession
I'm not gonna pretend to be the God of Computer Science. This series is extremely selfish in it's genesis and is meant to act as a reference point of sorts for the future me to refer to. I'm gonna make blog posts as I go along, some might be short, some might be long. In the end, the age old question rises again - "Does size matter?"

## Context
Coding is somewhat of a fad these days, "Oh, you don't know how to code? What are you even doing with your engineering degree.". As an added bonus, coding isn't something that requires a huge amount of capital investment and know how. You need a computer and that's pretty much it. At the heart of any field of engneering lies problem solving and algorithms are pieces of code that provide solution to those problems, data structures are kind of like vessels that entomb the algorithm and using the right data structure can make tremendous difference to the way your algorithm works.
