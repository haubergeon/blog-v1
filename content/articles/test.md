# Sorting Algorithms

## Selection Sort
A distinctive feature is that it takes the same amount of time for all n! permutations of its input array of n variables.

### Logic
It takes the smallest element from the array and puts it before all other elements, it then searches the remaining elements and finds the next smallest element and puts it at the second position and so on.
