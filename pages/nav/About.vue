  <h1 class="text-3xl m-1">Hey there!</h1>
  <p class="text-2xl">
     I started doing alot of learning when the lockdown started in India back in March 2020.
     I started with the basics of web development. Then I got bored of angular and decided to do something else altogether and so on and so forth, the cycle continued.
     Cut to 2021, I've forgotten more than I've managed to learn. 
     Born out of purely selfish reasons, this blog is meant to serve as a reference point of sorts, for me to refer to well into the future. 
     As an added bonus, this allows me to implement some of that web-dev know how from 2020 as I plan to do the whole thing from scratch, the website and all of it's quirks, no wordpress or other logical time-saving utilities.
     Also, I've always wanted to maintain a diary of sorts but the idea of designating a book to my thoughts and the whole dear diary thing. Mehh. Too cheesy.
     I mean Anne Frank had a diary and she really nailed it. It's really hard to beeat that. No matter how well of a diary you write, you'll always be second to Anne Frank.

      About me
    </h1>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      I had the pretentious urge to title this section "About the author", but I managed to keep the cringe in check {for now}. So about me.
      I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Electronics and Communication engineering. A more elaborate description befitting my epitaph would be :-
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl italic p-6">
      Gursimran of the House Singh, probably the Millionth of His Name, not the King of the Andals and the First Men, nor the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and nor Protector of the Realm. Westeros aside, I'm currently a sophomore at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology which is in the Northern part of India where i planned to reside till the end of my degree untill i was forced into exile by a not-so chivalrous gentleman that smote, both the elderly and the young of my realm and goes by the name of 'Covid'. So here I am residing in my Southern abode, staying inside the four walls of my keep hoping this miserly tyrant would go away. May the elves and dwarves come to our rescue!

    <h1 class="text-3xl m-4">
      So what is this blog about right now?
    </h1>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      Well. right now - I'm really into some tech stuff, Embedded Systems, Machine Learrning, Web-Dev - you know the fads. The second thing I'm really into these days is running.
      So right now, it's about all that. Maybe I'll really be into kids at some time in the future and this blog will transform into some sort of paedophilic altar.
      Jk. Jk.
