  <h1 class="text-3xl m-1">Hey there!</h1>
  <p class="text-2xl p-3">
     I started doing alot of learning when the lockdown started in India back in March 2020.
     I started with the basics of web development. Then I got bored of angular and decided to do something else altogether and so on and so forth, the cycle continued.
     Cut to 2021, I've forgotten more than I've managed to learn. 
     Born out of purely selfish reasons, this blog is meant to serve as a reference point of sorts, for me to refer to well into the future. 
     As an added bonus, this allows me to implement some of that web-dev know how from 2020 as I plan to do the whole thing from scratch, the website and all of it's quirks, no wordpress or other logical time-saving utilities.
     Also, I've always wanted to maintain a diary of sorts but the idea of designating a book to my thoughts and the whole dear diary thing. Mehh. Too cheesy.
     I mean Anne Frank had a diary and she really nailed it. It's really hard to beeat that. No matter how well of a diary you write, you'll always be second to Anne Frank.

      About me
    </h1>
    <p class="text-2xl p-3">
      I had the pretentious urge to title this section "About the author", but I managed to keep the cringe in check {for now}. So about me.
      I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Electronics and Communication engineering.

      So what is this blog about right now?
    </h1>
    <p class="text-2xl p-3">
      Well. right now - I'm really into some tech stuff, Embedded Systems, Machine Learrning, Web-Dev - you know the fads. The second thing I'm really into these days is running.
      So right now, it's about all that.
